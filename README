This is a port of the TwentyTen WordPress theme to MediaWiki.

INSTALLATION:

1. Copy the files to the 'skins' directory of your MediaWiki install.

2. In LocalSettings.php set the following variables (they can be either
   relative or full URLs):

   $wgLogo             = "http://example.com/logo.jpg";
   $wgTwentytenHeader  = "$wgStylePath/twentyten/headers/fern.jpg";

   The header image should be 940 pixels wide.

3. Then edit Mediawiki:Sidebar and add 'MENUBAR'and 'LOGO' sections, e.g.

   * MENUBAR
   ** Main Page|Home
   ** About|About
   ** Contact|Contact
   * LOGO

   You can also delete the toolbox section (because it's moved to one of the
   columns in the footer) and rearrange everything else to your liking.

4. Please report any problems or suggestions via Github:
