This is a port of the TwentyTen WordPress theme to MediaWiki.

INSTALLATION:

1. Copy the files to the 'skins' directory of your MediaWiki install.

2. In LocalSettings.php set the following variables (they can be either
   relative or full URLs):

   $wgLogo             = "http://example.com/logo.jpg";
   $wgTwentytenHeader  = "$wgStylePath/twentyten/headers/fern.jpg";


3. Then edit Mediawiki:Sidebar and add 'MENUBAR'and 'LOGO' sections, e.g.

   * MENUBAR
   ** Main Page|Home
   ** About|About
   ** Contact|Contact
   * LOGO

   You can also delete the toolbox section, and rearrange everything else to
   your liking.
